    This exception is raised in situations where the error condition is

    by user input.

    This exception indicates that an unexpected condition has occurred that
    typically results from a bug or flaw in the code logic. It represents
    errors that are not caused by user actions or external factors, but
    rather by mistakes or inconsistencies in the program's internal state.
