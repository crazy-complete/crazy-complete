    Generate Bash code that tracks and updates the current subcommand path.

    This function walks through all known command lines (starting from the given
    top-level `commandline`) and generates conditional Bash code that appends
    the currently matched subcommand to the `cmd` variable. This allows the
    generated completion script to keep track of the full subcommand hierarchy
    as the user types.

    While tracking, all variations of a subcommand are considered, including
    defined aliases and any supported abbreviations. This ensures that the
    resulting `cmd` variable always contains the canonical subcommand name,
    regardless of how the user typed it.
