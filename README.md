crazy-complete
==============

Every program should have autocompletion in the shell to enhance user experience and productivity. crazy-complete helps solve this task by generating robust and reliable autocompletion scripts.

**Key Features**:
- **Generates Robust Scripts**: Ensures that the autocompletion scripts are reliable and efficient.
- **Multi-Shell Support**: Works seamlessly with **Bash**, **Fish**, and **Zsh**, providing flexibility across different environments.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The only external dependency is PyYAML.
- **Configurable and Extendable**: The generated autocompletion scripts are highly configurable and can be easily extended to suit your specific needs.
- **Standalone Scripts**: The generated scripts are standalone and do not depend on modified environments, unlike some alternatives like argcomplete.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive to set up, allowing you to quickly add autocompletion functionality to your programs.

With crazy-complete, adding autocompletion to your programs has never been easier. Try it out and see the difference it makes in your command-line applications!

Benefits of Using crazy-complete
================================

- **Focus on what matters:**
  crazy-complete generates the basic structure of your autocompletion scripts,
  so you can focus entirely on defining options and their completions instead of dealing with repetitive setup code.

- **Cross-shell consistency:**
  Write your completion logic once and get reliable completions for **Bash**, **Zsh**, and **Fish**, with identical behavior across all shells.

- **Powerful argument completion:**
  crazy-complete provides a rich set of [built-in](docs/documentation.md#built-in-commands) helpers for argument completion and makes it simple to define your own [custom argument handlers](docs/documentation.md#user-defined-commands).

- **Arbitrary levels of subcommands:**
  No matter how deeply nested your CLI structure is, crazy-complete can handle it.
  You can define completions for commands, subcommands, and even sub-subcommands without extra effort.

- **Full control over options:**
  - **Repeatable / non-repeatable options**: control whether options can be used once or multiple times.
  - **Mutually exclusive options**: ensure that incompatible options cannot appear together.
  - **Conditional options**: only suggest options when certain conditions are met.
  - **Final options**: options that prevent any further options from being completed.
  - **Hidden options**: completable options that are not shown in the suggestion list.
  - **Capturing options**: collect options and their values to enable advanced, context-sensitive completions.

Disadvantages of crazy-complete
===============================

While crazy-complete offers many advantages, there are some trade-offs to be aware of:

- **Code size and verbosity:**
  Its biggest strength - **secure, fully controlled completions** - can also be its biggest weakness.
  - For **Bash**, this means the generated scripts contain a significant amount of boilerplate code for parsing options and positional arguments.
  - For **Fish**, large command-line definitions may result in slower completions, although performance is usually acceptable for most use cases.
  - **Mitigation:** There are ways to reduce script size and improve performance. See [Tips And Tricks](docs/documentation.md#tips-and-tricks) for more details.
- **Not as optimized as hand-written scripts:**
   The generated scripts prioritize correctness and reliability over minimal size or maximum performance. Hand-written scripts may be more compact and slightly faster in some cases.
