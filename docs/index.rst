Introduction
============

Every program should have autocompletion in the shell to enhance user experience
and productivity. **crazy-complete** solves this task by generating robust and
reliable autocompletion scripts.

Key Features
------------

* **Generates Robust Scripts** – Ensures that the autocompletion scripts are
  reliable and efficient.
* **Multi-Shell Support** – Works seamlessly with Bash, Fish, and Zsh, providing
  flexibility across different environments.
* **Minimal Dependencies** – The only external dependency is ``PyYAML``.
* **Configurable and Extendable** – The generated autocompletion scripts are
  highly configurable and can be easily extended to suit your specific needs.
* **Standalone Scripts** – The generated scripts are standalone and do not
  depend on modified environments, unlike some alternatives such as
  ``argcomplete``.
* **Easy to Use** – Simple and intuitive to set up, allowing you to quickly add
  autocompletion functionality to your programs.

With **crazy-complete**, adding autocompletion to your programs has never been
easier. Try it out and see the difference it makes in your command-line
